					<h4>Test Engineer and aspiring developer</h4>
					<p>
						Ever since I was young, I've been passionate about technology. I grew up very curious about the way things worked, so I would find myself tinkering
						around with technology that fascinated me. I eventually joined a competitive VEX Robotics team in High School where I really had my first experience
						with designing, building, and debugging the tech I worked on.
						I went to UC Irvine where I received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering in 2017.
						I'm currently working as a Test Engineer for AutoRoboto, at Google, where I'm assisting with the scaling effort to support AR capabilities on hundreds of 
						millions of Android devices.
						Some of my biggest interests include Machine Learning, Visual Odometry and 
						Computer Vision, Robotics, and Augmented Reality.

				<h4> Sustainability in 3D Printing Continued </h4>
				<p>
					One of the awesome projects I had the chance to take part in was a Plastic Recycling project. It started as a part of a prior project, Solar Decathlon, which 
					ended up producing plastic waste from the 3D Printed Objects used in one of its rooms. With the genius of my good friends, William Amos and Aldrin Lupisan, and
					the guidance of Professor Jesse Jackson, this team was born.

				<h4> <a href="https://art.arts.uci.edu/press/arts-and-engineering-students-place-fourth-prestigious-national-contest">The Birth of Closed Loop Plastics</a> </h4>
				<p>
					Will and Aldrin were able to take this project in many different directions, and they eventually turned it into their own start-up "Closed Loop Plastics". Before
					that, we participated in various competitions, won awards such as Dean's Choice Award in the UC Irvine Engineering department. We pitched this project in front of
					Professors, students, industry professionals, and many more. We also participated in the Richard Barrentine Values and Ventures Competition where we placed
					an honorable mention 4th place out of the 56 teams competing internationally.
